# CppProject-TPs

This repository contains a collection of C++ practical works that I completed in class. The practical works cover various topics including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. Each practical work is contained in its own folder, along with a brief description of the task and any relevant files.

## Contents

- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Recursion
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Templates and STL

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g. GCC, Clang)
- A text editor or IDE

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cpp-class-practical-works.git`.
2. Navigate to the folder of the practical work you want to run.
3. Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable file.
